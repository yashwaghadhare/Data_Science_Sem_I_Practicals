Step 1: Prepare the Data File
- Open Excel or any spreadsheet software
- Enter data with clear column headers (e.g., Region, Sales, Profit)
- Ensure each row represents one record
- Click File → Save As
- Choose CSV (Comma delimited) as the file format
- Save the file to an easily accessible location
Step 2: Open Tableau Desktop
- Launch Tableau Desktop
- On the start page, click “Microsoft Excel” or “Text File” (based on your saved format)
- Locate and open your CSV file
- Tableau loads data into the Data Source tab
- Click “Sheet 1” at the bottom to start building charts
Step 3: Create Charts and Graphs
- In the sheet view, locate fields (Dimensions and Measures) in the left sidebar
- Drag a Dimension (e.g., Region) → Columns shelf
- Drag a Measure (e.g., Sales) → Rows shelf
- Tableau auto-generates a chart (default: Bar Chart)
- Use the “Show Me” panel to change chart type
- Add more Dimensions/Measures as needed for richer visuals
Step 4: Customize the Chart
- Change chart type using Marks card or “Show Me” panel
- Enhance visuals by dragging fields to:
  * Color
